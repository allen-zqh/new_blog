I have just gotten the Degree of M.S. and graduated from _Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)_. It a long journey in BUPT, thanks a lot.

I mainly focus on _Natural Language Processing_, including text classification, summarization and recommendation. Moreover, I am doing some research on _Data Science_ (e.p: prediction on time-series data) recently.
