I have just gotten the Degree of M.S. and graduated from **_Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)_**. It a long journey in BUPT, and finally we have a special online graduation ceremony, thanks a lot. 

I mainly focus on **_Natural Language Processing_**, including text classification, summarization and recommendation. Moreover, I am doing some research on **_Data Science_** (e.g. prediction on time-series data) recently.

You can refer to my research in **Projects** and **Pubilcations** this page and I also record my recent work and idea in **Posts**. I will update this page as possible.
