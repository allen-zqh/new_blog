<small>(2020-10-06 22:41 in Changchun, China)  I am now in the [Preparatory School for Chinese Students to Japan](http://lryx.nenu.edu.cn/), [Northeast Normal University (NENU)](http://www.nenu.edu.cn/) for taking Japanese course, arranged by the [2021 MEXT Scholarship](https://www.mext.go.jp/content/20200521-mxt_gakushi02-000007188-02.pdf). The expected study time is from Oct, 2020 to Aug, 2021.</small>

I was selected by BUPT and attended into [Ye Peida Institute](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8F%B6%E5%9F%B9%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E9%99%A2/4492808?fr=aladdin) when I was an undergraduate. Under the guidance of [Prof. Liu Liang](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/info/1097/1346.htm), I learned about compression sensing, multimedia computing and intelligent text processing. The undergraduate thesis "_The Design and Implementation of Chaotic Compressive Sensing Algorithm_" won "_2017 Excellent Undergraduate Graduation Thesis Award_" in BUPT. After entering the graduate school, I studied under [Prof. Yang Wenchuan](https://scss.bupt.edu.cn/info/1063/1135.htm) to continue learning natural language processing related research topics.

Here is Zhao Qiuhan, a Ph.d student belonging to [Motohashi Laboratory](http://www.mo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), Department of Technology Management for Innovation ([TMI](https://tmi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/)), supervised by [Prof. Motohashi Kazuyuki](http://www.mo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/member_motohashi.html). I mainly focus on **_Natural Language Processing_**, **_Data Science_**, and it's application in **_Science Economy_**.
