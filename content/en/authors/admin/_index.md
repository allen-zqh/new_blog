I have just got the Degree of M.S. and graduated from **_Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)_**. It is a long journey in BUPT, and finally we have a special online graduation ceremony, thanks a lot. 

I was selected by BUPT and attended into [Ye Peida Institute](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8F%B6%E5%9F%B9%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E9%99%A2/4492808?fr=aladdin) when I was an undergraduate. Under the guidance of [Prof. Liu Liang](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/info/1097/1346.htm), I learned about compression sensing, multimedia computing and intelligent text processing. The undergraduate thesis "_The Design and Implementation of Chaotic Compressive Sensing Algorithm_" won "_2017 Excellent Undergraduate Graduation Thesis Award_" in BUPT. After entering the graduate school, I studied under [Associate Prof. Yang Wenchuan](https://scss.bupt.edu.cn/info/1063/1135.htm) to continue learning natural language processing related research topics.

I mainly focus on **_Natural Language Processing_**, including text classification, summarization and recommendation. Moreover, I am doing some research on **_Data Science_** (e.g. prediction on time-series data) recently.

You can refer to my research in **Projects** and **Publications** this page and I also record my recent work and idea in **Posts**. I will update this page as possible. Additionally, you can click the button in the upper right corner to switch language _(EN-CN-JP)_, but CN and JP only contain personal information page.
