## Begin

This is my new blog. This blog is mainly used to introduce some of my work and resume. In addition, I will post some recent research progress and results in **Posts** part from time to time. The old one can be followed as: [Allen.c](https://www.cnblogs.com/catallen/).

I have updated some of my experience and intern. Because the recent work and projects are quite busy, the **Publication** part will be organized in future.  I will finish my graduation thesis and prepare for the defense next year. Finally, good luck!
