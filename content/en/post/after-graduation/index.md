## Graduation

It is a long journey in _Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications_. I have been in Beijing for 7 years. However, I have no chance to get back to the campus due to the coronavirus. So, we just hold an online procedure for graduation.

## Schedule

After graduation, I have planed for my futhur study. The schedule is shown as follows:

1. Learn Japanese, 2020.08-09. Cause the busy work in lab, I still not finish some Japanese courses.
2. Keep reading and learning.
