  --_**The Shawshank Redemption**_--

_"I guess it comes down to a simple choice:get busy living or get busy dying."_

## B

There are still 10 days to go before the Japanese course next month. In the past few days, I have revised the pictures in the journal paper I collaborated with my friend. In addition, the remaining time is to organize the photos in the phone.

This picture was taken in the spring of 2017, when I just passed the interview of the lab and became a prospective graduate student. At that time, the graduation thesis was almost completed. Without any worries, I was planning the itinerary and arrangement of the graduation trip.

One year spent similar, each year is different. After growing up, there are always a lot of troubles, but you can't stop because of anxiety. My grandfather has been in poor health recently, which is very different from the physical condition during the Chinese New Year; many things have no results, paper, scholarship and etc., all require me to wait more patiently.

Probably because of the epidemic, I stopped at home. My peers have started to work, regularly from 9 to 5(maybe, I just say);  the childhood sweethearts who used to play together during the winter and summer vacations all have their own careers and busy schedules. 

My way of dealing with anxiety is football and singing. I played football with a group of kids who just finished the college entrance examination. For them, life is new and full of expectations. The college entrance examination results will be announced next week. I hope all goes well for them. For me, I understand that any waiting is meaningful, but anxiety will not decrease. Probably this is the experience of life after growing up. I began to miss that spring of 2017, a carefree day without thinking about the future.

As **CORO** causes financial problems at home, maybe I will give up the existing offer and continue to wait and challenge. This is very difficult, really. But I can't give up, I can only enrich my life in the blank time, and then continue to wait. I hope everything goes well and my dreams come true, just like the flowers in Xitucheng Park in the spring of 2017, blooming wantonly. From No. 10 Xitucheng Road, where will I go.

We just made some corrections to the content of the journal article, so I have to continue to modify the picture after writing this essay. End with this from my girlfriend:  _"I will be there in 25."_ Complaining a lot, life still has to go on. Keep waiting, keep learning. Good luck!
