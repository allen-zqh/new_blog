## Project Introduction

This project is cooperated with the Intelligence Institute. The project aims at the shortcomings of the new knowledge discovery system last year and studies key documents in the development process by statistical method.

## Procedure
It intends to present users in the way of a development map, allowing relevant practitioners and laymen to see the development process and key technological innovations in the most direct manner in this field. At the same time, it constructs confusion matrix of keywords based on statistical data, to forecast the future development of key technologies in the field. _The project is expected to conclude in **October next year**_.
