## Project Introduction

The subject is a research project. It intends to find a **new cross-disciplinary** law by using text multi-label technology from the growing scientific and technological literature.

## Procedure
Based on text multi-label technology and density clustering method, we find a number of new label combinations in scientific and technological literature which are different from the previous findings. Their labels may be the same or similar combinations. The system is also intended to provide decision support for government departments to develop disciplines. It also has certain reference significance for schools to set up new disciplines and departments.
